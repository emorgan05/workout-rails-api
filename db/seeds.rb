Place your feet shoulder-width apart or slightly wider. Extend your hands straight out in front of you to help keep your balance. You can also bend the elbows or clasp the fingers.
Sit back and down like you're sitting into an imaginary chair. Keep your head facing forward as your upper body bends forward a bit. Rather than allowing your back to round, let your lower back arch slightly as you descend.
Lower down so your thighs are as parallel to the floor as possible, with your knees over your ankles. Press your weight back into your heels.
Keep your body tight, and push through your heels to bring yourself back to the starting position.",

Before you begin any movement, contract your abs and tighten your core by pulling your belly button toward your spine. Keep a tight core throughout the entire push up.
Inhale as you slowly bend your elbows and lower yourself until your elbows are at a 90 degree angle.
Exhale as you begin contracting your chest muscles and pushing back up through your hands to the start position. Don't lock out the elbows; keep them slightly bent.",

Place the right leg on top of the end of the bench, bend your torso forward from the waist until your upper body is parallel to the floor, and place your right hand on the other end of the bench for support.
Use the left hand to pick up the dumbbell on the floor and hold the weight while keeping your lower back straight. The palm of the hand should be facing your torso. This will be your starting position.
Pull the resistance straight up to the side of your chest, keeping your upper arm close to your side and keeping the torso stationary. Breathe out as you perform this step. Tip: Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the full contracted position. Also, make sure that the force is performed with the back muscles and not the arms. Finally, the upper torso should remain stationary and only the arms should move. The forearms should do no other work except for holding the dumbbell; therefore do not try to pull the dumbbell up using the forearms.
Lower the resistance straight down to the starting position. Breathe in as you perform this step.
Repeat the movement for the specified amount of repetitions.
Switch sides and repeat again with the other arm.",

Neutralize the neck and spine by looking at a spot on the floor about a foot beyond the hands. Your head should be in line with your back.
Hold the position for 20 seconds. As you get more comfortable with the move, hold your plank for as long as possible without compromising form or breath.",

    description: "Starting Position: Stand with your feet hip-width apart, pull your shoulders down and back without arching your low back, and 'brace' to stiffen your spine.
Downward Phase: Begin your downward phase by first shifting your hips backwards then slowly moving downwards to create a hinge-like movement at your knees. Continue to lower yourself until your feel your heels about to lift off the floor. Try to maintain a flat back by bending forward at the hips. Keep your head facing forward or to the floor, and extend your arms to reach directly behind you while keeping the elbows straight.
Jumping Movement: With ONLY a very brief pause at the bottom of your downward phase, explode forward and upwards through your lower extremity while throwing your arms overhead to achieve triple extension (pushing and extending your ankles, knees and hips simultaneously). As your jump into the air, try to keep your feet next to each other.
While in the air traveling forward pull your legs in front of you while keeping your feet next to each other in order to prepare for the landing.  Your head should be level with your eyes looking to the spot on the floor where you want to land.
Your legs should be in front of you with the feet parallel next to each other, bend the knees and flex the hips to prepare to absorb the impact forces of the landing.  Keep your eyes on the floor to prepare for the landing.
Landing phase: Keep your feet parallel next to each other and attempt to land softly on the whole foot, let the balls of the feet hit the ground first and quickly roll down to your heels while sinking your weight back into your heels and hips.  Use the rapid bending of the hips and knees to absorb the impact forces of the landing, do not land with a straight or hyper-extended knee as this could create an injury."
